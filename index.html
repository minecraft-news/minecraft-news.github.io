                <h3>Minecraft Is Now Broken</h3>
                <p>Before Notch sold minecraft for 2,5 billion dolars, minecraft was perfectly good. But when Notch sold minecraft, it was over.</p>
                <p>I just feel nostalgia for the old versions, most nostalgia i feel for minecraft a1.0.4 - 1.8.9 new versions are not that good for me.</p>
                <p>You can tell me what do you think on my discord: fryderyk_antekk3 (antekk), see ya in new thread.</p>

                    <h3>Herobrine Catched On 1.20.1!</h3>
                    <p>My History: One time i was playing on my multiplayer server with one person, i dont want to tell who is that person.</p>
                    <p>I was in our minecraft home, i walked trough the door (from home side) and in front of me there was a lake, i turned slightly to the right,</p>
                    <p>and I thought there was something similar to Steve's character and I took a screenshot and then I was looking at the screenshot and I saw it.</p>

                <h3>Who is "Entity 303"</h3>
                <p>Entity 303 (nicknamed "303") is a creepypasta commonly said to be "the New Herobrine". According to the pasta, a former Mojang employee was fired by Notch (the creator of Minecraft).</p>
                <p>Now he wants revenge on Mojang and Minecraft players alike. Entity 303 is said to be not just the former employee but a whole team of hackers going by usernames like "303mojang.com303," and "entity.303".</p>
                <p> If you have any files in your computer that are named anything with "303", then it could be 303's hackers. 303 can also hack in to player's worlds and corrupt them. 1/40 players are affected by 303 and his team. Herobrine actually came to warn us about 303 by showing what he would do.</p>
                <p> 303 plans to ruin Minecraft by the end of 2014 or 2015. Signs have been seen in worlds hacked by 303 saying "hjälp" ("help" in Swedish).</p>
                <p> That means Herobrine needs our help (or hjälp) to defeat 303. If he is not defeated soon Minecraft will be in his control. (Note: the first 303 sighting happened on December 10, 2013. The events of that encounter are not known)</p>
