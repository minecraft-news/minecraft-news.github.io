                <p></p>
                <a href="aternos.org">1. Aternos</a>

                <p></p>
                <a href="https://feathermc.com">2. Minecraft feather client</a>
                <p>FeatherMC is a minecraft client. But it has option to create servers. It's a little bit harder that on aternos, but it's a lot better.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>3. Make server for your own.</p>
                <p>It's harder, just harder. I will not describe it here. There is a official tutorial down bellow.</p>

                <h3>Who is "Entity 303"</h3>
                <p>Entity 303 (nicknamed "303") is a creepypasta commonly said to be "the New Herobrine". According to the pasta, a former Mojang employee was fired by Notch (the creator of Minecraft).</p>
                <p>Now he wants revenge on Mojang and Minecraft players alike. Entity 303 is said to be not just the former employee but a whole team of hackers going by usernames like "303mojang.com303," and "entity.303".</p>
                <p> If you have any files in your computer that are named anything with "303", then it could be 303's hackers. 303 can also hack in to player's worlds and corrupt them. 1/40 players are affected by 303 and his team. Herobrine actually came to warn us about 303 by showing what he would do.</p>
                <p> 303 plans to ruin Minecraft by the end of 2014 or 2015. Signs have been seen in worlds hacked by 303 saying "hjälp" ("help" in Swedish).</p>
                <p> That means Herobrine needs our help (or hjälp) to defeat 303. If he is not defeated soon Minecraft will be in his control. (Note: the first 303 sighting happened on December 10, 2013. The events of that encounter are not known)</p>
